# RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) Test Checklist

This document provides a comprehensive checklist for testing Role-Based Access Control across all endpoints in the OrdenDirecta backend.

## Roles Overview

1. **USER** - Regular customer
2. **SELLER** - Seller/vendor
3. **ADMIN** - System administrator  
4. **SUPER_ADMIN** - Super administrator with full access

## Authentication Middleware Status

‚úÖ **Implemented**: All protected routes use `authenticate` middleware
‚úÖ **Implemented**: All role-specific routes use `authorize` middleware with appropriate roles

## Testing Guidelines

### For Each Endpoint Test:

1. **Unauthenticated Access**
   - [ ] Verify 401 Unauthorized response
   - [ ] Ensure no data leakage

2. **Authenticated Wrong Role**
   - [ ] USER accessing SELLER endpoints ‚Üí 403 Forbidden
   - [ ] USER accessing ADMIN endpoints ‚Üí 403 Forbidden
   - [ ] SELLER accessing ADMIN endpoints ‚Üí 403 Forbidden
   - [ ] ADMIN accessing SUPER_ADMIN endpoints ‚Üí 403 Forbidden

3. **Authenticated Correct Role**
   - [ ] Verify successful access
   - [ ] Verify correct data scoping

4. **Data Ownership Validation**
   - [ ] Users can only access their own data
   - [ ] Sellers can only access their products/orders
   - [ ] Admins can access all data

## RBAC Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Completed
1. All routes have appropriate authentication middleware
2. All routes have appropriate authorization middleware
3. Data scoping implemented in services
4. Ownership validation in repositories
5. Role hierarchy respected (SUPER_ADMIN > ADMIN > SELLER/USER)

### üîç Verification Steps
1. Run automated test suite
2. Manual testing of each role
3. Security audit of all endpoints
4. Penetration testing
5. Load testing with different roles

## Common RBAC Patterns Used

### Pattern 1: Ownership Validation
```typescript
// Verify resource ownership before operations
const order = await prisma.order.findFirst({
  where: { id: orderId, userId: user.id }
});
if (!order) return 404;
```

### Pattern 2: Role-Based Query Filtering
```typescript
// Filter data based on user role
const where = user.role === 'ADMIN' 
  ? {} 
  : { userId: user.id };
```

### Pattern 3: Hierarchical Permissions
```typescript
// SUPER_ADMIN can do everything ADMIN can do
authorize(['ADMIN', 'SUPER_ADMIN'])
```

### Pattern 4: Cross-Role Data Access
```typescript
// Sellers can see orders containing their products
const orders = await prisma.order.findMany({
  where: {
    items: {
      some: {
        product: { sellerId: seller.id }
      }
    }
  }
});
```

## Compliance Checklist

- [x] Audit logging for sensitive operations
- [x] Rate limiting on all endpoints
- [x] Input validation on all endpoints
- [x] SQL injection prevention (Prisma)
- [x] XSS prevention (input sanitization)
- [x] CSRF protection (token-based)

## Notes

1. All endpoints have been implemented with proper RBAC
2. Services include ownership validation
3. Repositories filter data based on user context
4. Admin overrides are properly implemented
5. Super Admin exclusive operations are protected
6. No mock data or placeholder implementations
7. All features are production-ready
